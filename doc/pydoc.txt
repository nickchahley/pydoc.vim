PYDOC                                                              *pydoc* *Pydoc*
==============================================================================

This plugin integrates the Python documentation view and search tool pydoc
into Vim. It allows you to view the documentation of a Python module or class
by typing:

:Pydoc foo.bar.baz (e.g. :Pydoc re.compile)

Or search a word (uses pydoc -k) in the documentation by typing:

:PydocSearch foobar (e.g. :PydocSearch socket)

Vim will split the current window to show the Python documentation found by
pydoc (the buffer will be called '__doc__', Pythonic, isn't it ;-) ). The
name may cause problems if you have a file with the same name, but usually
this should not happen.

pydoc.vim also allows you to view the documentation of the 'word' (see :help
word) under the cursor by pressing <Leader>pw or the 'WORD' (see :help WORD)
under the cursor by pressing <Leader>pW. This is very useful if you want to
jump to the docs of a module or class found by 'PydocSearch' or if you want
to see the docs of a module/class in your source code. Additionally K is
mapped to show invoke pydoc as well, when you are editing python files.

The script is developed in GitHub at:

http://github.com/fs111/pydoc.vim


If you want to use the script and pydoc is not in your PATH, just put a
line like this in your .vimrc:

let g:pydoc_cmd = '/usr/bin/pydoc'

or more portable

let g:pydoc_cmd = 'python -m pydoc'

If you want to open pydoc files in vertical splits or tabs, give the
appropriate command in your .vimrc with:

let g:pydoc_open_cmd = 'vsplit'

or

let g:pydoc_open_cmd = 'tabnew'

The script will highlight the search term by default. To disable this behaviour
put in your .vimrc:

let g:pydoc_highlight=0

If you want pydoc to switch to an already open tab with pydoc page,
set this variable in your .vimrc (uses drop - requires vim compiled with
gui!):

let g:pydoc_use_drop=1

Pydoc files are open with 10 lines height, if you want to change this value
put this in your .vimrc:

let g:pydoc_window_lines=15
or
let g:pydoc_window_lines=0.5

Float values specify a percentage of the current window.


In order to install pydoc.vim download it from vim.org or clone the repository
on githubi and put it in your .vim/ftplugin directory. pydoc.vim is also fully
compatible with pathogen, so cloning the repository into your bundle directory
is also a valid way to install it. (I do this myself. see
https://github.com/fs111/dotvim).
